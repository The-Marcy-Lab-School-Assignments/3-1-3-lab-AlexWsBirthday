# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer
The benefits to explicitly stating the type of script you're importing into the DOM:

1. Enables support for JS ES6 modules, which allows you to easily import/export functions to/from different files. This helps you structure your code modularly, in an organized manner. 

2. The code will not run (it will be deferred) until the html loads, which allows the html to render and the scripts to run smoothly. Rather than the scripts interrupt the html rendering, only to come up with errors that could've been prevented if all of the html had been loaded and ready to use.
