# Question

What is the danger behind inserting user entered information *directly* into the DOM unescaped?

# Answer
The user could feed information into the DOM that changes the website, or even worse, tampers with the server you're holding your site's information in. By not safeguarding user input "portals", you open your site to attacks.
