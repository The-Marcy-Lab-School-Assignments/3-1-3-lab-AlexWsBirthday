# Question

Translate the following code into `async/await` please.

```js
const getAllUsers = () => {
   fetch('https://example.com/users')
    .then(r => r.json())
    .then(users => {
      console.log('users:', users)
      return users
    })
    .catch(console.warn)
}

```

Make sure to keep all variable and function names the same. The function must behave the same way.


# Answer

```js
const getAllUsers = () => {
 try {

    //wait for the fetch to get the users data from the url
    const response = await fetch('https://example.com/users')
    //checking if the response from the fetch attempt was okay, if not, here's how to handle it:
    if (!response.ok) {
      //throw a new error if the data was unable to be retrieved with the status so we know WHERE along the way something went wrong
      //(source of error), and the message telling us WHAT went wrong 
      throw new Error(`Fetch failed with status - ${response.status}, ${response.message}`)
    }

    //however, if (response.ok):

    //check if the data is in JSON. despite being in an async function, I'm pretty sure that this is purposefully made to be syncronous 
    //so that data runs second (and waits for the result from isJson first).
     const isJson = (response.headers.get('content-type') || '').includes('application/json')

    //checking if (isJson) -- if true, wait for the response, if not, wait for the text
      let data = isJson ? await response.json() : await response.text()

      //if response.json() in data, the variable data will hold the information successfully fetched from the url. 
      //this will allow us to log all the users!

      //Get the user data from the users key in the information we just fetched
      let users = data.users 

      //do the thing we originally wanted to do ig idk
      console.log('users:', users)

  } catch (error) {

      console.warn(error)

      return null
  }
  
}

//reference 
export const fetchHandler = async (url, options = {}) => {

    try {
        //fetching data using the arguments from fetchHandler
        const response = await fetch(url, options);

        //checking if the fetch promise is settled properly
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`Fetch failed with status - ${response.status}, ${response.message}`)
        }

        //response type check function 
        const isJson = (response.headers.get('content-type') || '').includes('application/json')

        //getting data by checking if the response is json first, then translating it into JS
        let data = isJson ? await response.json() : await response.text()

        //logging the data in the console
        console.log(data)

        //returning the data 
        return [data, null];

    } catch (error) {
        console.warn(error);

        return [null, error]
    }



};
```
