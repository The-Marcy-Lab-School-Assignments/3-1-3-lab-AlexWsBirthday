# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer
Using semantic elements means to be clear about the kind of element that you are trying to render, using the specific tag for said element. For example, rather than use a `<div>` tag and label it/id it as a header, you'd use the `<header>` tag to let the website know and people reading your code know that this part of the website is a header. Same goes for the navigation section, the article, the body, the footer, etc.
